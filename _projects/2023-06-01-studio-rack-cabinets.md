The rack is split into two sections for distinct tasks: an angled tier on the right for mixing and a drawer on the left with a turntable for sampling. The assembly was straightforward, with each piece fitting together according to the template, combining functionality with personal style.

Building this rack was about blending planning with execution. The final piece meets the daily demands of studio use and reflects a personal approach to music production. It's a practical example in my portfolio, showcasing woodworking that is both effective and tailored to a musician's workflow.
