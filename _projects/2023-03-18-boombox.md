Drawing direct inspiration from the Teenage Engineering [OB-4](https://teenage.engineering/products/ob-4), I aimed to create a speaker that performs well both outdoors and indoors. The design focuses on delivering quality sound across different spaces, ensuring the music is always a central part of the experience.

The user interface reflects a philosophy of simplicity: a single knob controls power and volume, eliminating unnecessary complexity. This speaker is a practical example of my design approachâ€”functional, straightforward, and inspired by a well-regarded classic in the world of portable audio. It's a functional piece that underscores my commitment to crafting audio equipment that's intuitive and enjoyable to use in any setting.
