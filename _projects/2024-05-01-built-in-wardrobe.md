For this project, I crafted a built-in wardrobe from Baltic birch plywood, coated with a durable clear phenolic laminate for extra durability and to enhance the wood’s natural finish, complementing the client's home decor. The wood was carefully selected to ensure the grains matched beautifully, which really makes the piece stand out.

The wardrobe includes three main sections, with four drawers under the hanging spaces, tailored to the client’s storage needs. Its design is clean and modern, with full overlay doors that highlight the wood’s natural beauty. We decided on nylon straps for the door pulls, tucked into the door edges, to keep the look sleek and uninterrupted—inspired by the clever touches in sports car design.

Building this wardrobe involved precise cutting and assembly to make sure everything lined up perfectly, especially the doors, where the matching wood grain was a key feature.

Choosing materials and fittings was a joint effort, focusing on practicality and aesthetics. The nylon strap door pulls are a simple yet effective solution that maintains the wardrobe’s minimalist vibe while adding a unique touch.

This project was a great blend of form and function, producing a piece that's not only useful but also a visual highlight in the client's bedroom. It was a fantastic opportunity to deliver custom craftsmanship that truly fits the client’s style and space.
