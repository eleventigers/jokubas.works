This storage and seating combo was built for the entryway of a mid-century home in South Pasadena. Inspired by Danish rack-mounted furniture, it includes tilt-out drawers for shoes, an upper cabinet for small items like wallets and keys, and a bench for convenience while changing. The piece is made from grain-matched walnut with black Formica accents, paired with custom yellow-painted metalwork that adds both support and a striking contrast to the walnut’s natural warmth.

The design process started with conversations about the client's needs, space constraints, surrounding materials, and sources of inspiration. While the initial plan was to create a fully floating cabinet for both storage and seating, it was ultimately ruled out due to the wall’s insufficient structural support.

The next iteration embraced a more minimal approach, eliminating the built-in bench while retaining the floating design through wall-mounted rails. The client appreciated the modern aesthetic but remained eager to incorporate a bench into the piece. They were also keen on having all cabinet doors feature a push-to-open mechanism to align with other cabinetry in their home. With this feedback, we continued refining the design, striving to achieve the perfect balance between form and function.

Throughout the iterative process, we explored various combinations of legs, rails, and color options, experimenting with how each element contributed to the overall design and functionality. It became increasingly clear that a more robust metal leg frame was essential—not only to support the piece under daily use but also to handle occasional heavy loads.

The final design features two rectangular metal legs connected by horizontal cross members, offering strong support for both the bench and the shoe cabinet. After incorporating the client's feedback, the dimensions were refined to achieve a more balanced and cohesive look. Ultimately, the process highlighted the importance of carefully considering every detail to create a design that not only looks beautiful but also offers exceptional functionality. The result is a piece that seamlessly blends form and practicality, fulfilling the client’s needs while elevating the space.
