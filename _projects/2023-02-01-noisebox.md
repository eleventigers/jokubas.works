The Noisebox is a minimalist noise machine, purposefully created to emit a calming pink noise, perfect for promoting restful sleep. Initially envisioned as a gentle sleep aid for my newborn son, it encapsulates a design that is both beautiful in its simplicity and singular in its function, featuring a custom-designed sound generation PCBâ€”a project that marked a new foray into the intricacies of electronic design for me.

The Noisebox's compact form, measuring just 4 x 4 x 4 inches, ensures it fits unobtrusively on any bedside table or bookshelf. Made from quality birch plywood, it presents a natural and durable alternative to common plastic units. Its rechargeable 2200 mAh lithium battery delivers 7-14 days of use on a full charge, varying with volume levels, which adds to its portability.

With the absence of exposed LED lights, it's crafted to promote undisturbed sleep. To minimize environmental waste, the Noisebox does not include a separate charger or cable, as it can be charged using its USB-C port with any standard charging source.
