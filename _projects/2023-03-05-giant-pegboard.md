The Giant Pegboard crafted to offer flexibility and simplicity in a common play/den area. Constructed from durable Baltic birch plywood and finished in satin white, this pegboard blends effortlessly with its environment while providing a customizable storage solution.

Its design serves a long-term vision, allowing shelves to be repositioned as needs evolve over months or years. The choice of material and color was intentional, ensuring the pegboard remains a classic fixture against the changing tides of home decor and utility.
