I come from a world of software engineering and [music](https://soundcloud.com/eleventigers), but it's in woodworking where I've truly found my stride. My work is all about keeping things simple and functional. I love clean lines and designs that don't shout for attention but still catch your eye. It's this mix of my tech background and creative side that lets me craft pieces that are not just useful but also built to last.

When I'm not in my workshop, you'll often find me wandering through the quiet of the desert. It's a stark contrast to my tech days, but it's where I find a lot of my inspiration. Moving from the digital to the tactile, from coding to crafting with wood, has been a big change, but it's one I embrace fully. It reflects my dedication not just to making things by hand, but to living and working in a way that's mindful and sustainable.
